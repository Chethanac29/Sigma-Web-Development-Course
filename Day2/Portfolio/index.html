    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Verification of UART Protocol using Universal Verification Method.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed UART on chip protocol which has Receiver and Transmitter where both operates on different standard Baud rates.</li>
            <li> It contains also Error checking mechanism using Odd or Even Parity bits and contains single start and double stop bits and can transfer a data of size between 5 bits to 8 bits.</li>
            <li> Verification of this protocol using standard UVM testbench and Covering all the possible Test cases using Functional Coverage and Assertions</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><h4>Design and Verification of FIFO uding SystemVerilog.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Optimized the FIFO design to synchronize read and write operations seamlessly with the clock signal, ensuring
                efficient data transfer and minimizing clock cycle overhead.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s a 8 byte FIFO with synchronized read and write
                speeds. It involved the SystemVerilog test bench for the Verification with Assertions and Coverage.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><h4>RSA Encryption Algorithm Implementation using Verilog.</h4><ul>
            <li>
                Built a digital design of RSA Encryption Algorithm using Verilog a hardware description language and verified its
                functionality using linear testbench with the knowledge of cryptography. 
            </li>
            <li>
                RSA encryption algorithm is asymmetric
                encryption algorithm which involves two types of keys and involves complex modular arithmetic operations and prime
                factorisation to encrypt and decrypt a message
            </li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><h4>Electric Two Wheeler design.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Worked on a group project building the electrical two wheeler for participating in the National level two wheeler
design competition SAE ETWDC.
            </li>
            <li>
                Implemented different features like Cruise Control, Corner Bending Lights,
Active GPS system, Secure Notification system.
            </li>
        </ul></li>
        <li><h4>Automated Railway Signalling and Communication System.</h4><ul>
            <li>
                Build a project that compute the distance between two trains travelling on the same track using Embedded Systems, C, Python
            </li>
            <li>
                This project uses the haversine formula to calculate the distance between two trains by getting
their coordinates(latitude, longitude) and will generate a notification if the distance between the two trains reaches
a threshold of 5km.
            </li>
